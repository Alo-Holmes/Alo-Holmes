# 👋 Hi, I'm Alo-Holmes

I'm a QA Engineer with over a decade of experience in the software testing industry. My journey began as a functional tester, and I've since advanced through technical and leadership roles, including specialist QA Analyst positions. I've worked with both large multinational enterprises and dynamic, smaller teams.
